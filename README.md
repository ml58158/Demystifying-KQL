# Demystifying-KQL
Content Repo for Demystifying KQL Tutorial Series

This series is a passion project of mine to help SOC Analysts get up to speed on KQL to use Microsoft Sentinel. 
It is designed to give a foundational knowledge of KQL and enable you to ramp up on writing basic security related queries. 

This is the first of my KQL Series that will be published.
